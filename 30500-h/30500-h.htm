<h1><span class="sp1">THE PASSENGER</span></h1>

<div class="bk1"><h2>By KENNETH HARMON</h2>

<div class="bq"><p><big><b><i>The classic route to a man's
heart is through his stomach&mdash;and she was just his dish.</i></b></big></p></div>

<b>Illustrated by CONNELL</b></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> transport swung past
Centaurus on the last leg
of her long journey to Sol.
There was no flash, no roar as
she swept across the darkness of
space. As silent as a ghost, as
quiet as a puff of moonlight she
moved, riding the gravitational
fields that spread like tangled,
invisible spider webs between the
stars.</p>

<p>Within the ship there was also
silence, but the air was stirred by
a faint, persistent vibration from
the field generators. This noiseless
pulse stole into every corner
of the ship, through long, empty
passageways lined with closed
stateroom doors, up spiraling
stairways to the bridge and navigational
decks, and down into
vast and echoing holds, filled with
strange cargo from distant worlds.</p>

<p>This vibration pulsed through
Lenore's stateroom. As she relaxed
on her couch, she bathed
in it, letting it flow through her
to tingle in her fingertips and
whisper behind her closed eyelids.</p>

<p>"Home," it pulsed, "you're going
home."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">She</span> repeated the word to herself,
moving her lips softly but
making no sound. "Home," she
breathed, "back home to Earth."
Back to the proud old planet that
was always home, no matter how
far you wandered under alien
suns. Back to the shining cities
clustered along blue seacoasts.
Back to the golden grainlands of
the central states and the high,
blue grandeur of the western
mountains. And back to the myriad
tiny things that she remembered
best, the little, friendly
things ... a stretch of maple-shadowed
streets heavy and still
with the heat of a summer noon;
a flurry of pigeons in the courthouse
square; yellow dandelions
in a green lawn, the whir of a
lawnmower and the smell of the
cut grass; ivy on old bricks and
the rough feel of oak bark under
her hands; water lilies and watermelons
and crepe papery dances
and picnics by the river in the
summer dusk; and the library
steps in the evening, with fireflies
in the cool grass and the school
chimes sounding the slow hours
through the friendly dark.</p>

<p>She thought to herself, "It's
been such a long time since you
were home. There will be a whole
new flock of pigeons now." She
smiled at the recollection of the
eager, awkward girl of twenty
that she had been when she had
finished school and had entered
the Government Education Service.
"Travel While Helping Others"
had been the motto of the
GES.</p>

<p>She had traveled, all right, a
long, long way inside a rusty
freighter without a single porthole,
to a planet out on the rim
of the Galaxy that was as barren
and dreary as a cosmic slag heap.
Five years on the rock pile, five
years of knocking yourself out
trying to explain history and
Shakespeare and geometry to a
bunch of grubby little miners'
kids in a tin schoolhouse at the
edge of a cluster of tin shacks
that was supposed to be a town.
Five years of trudging around
with your nails worn and dirty
and your hair chopped short, of
wearing the latest thing in overalls.
Five years of not talking with
the young miners because they
got in trouble with the foreman,
and not talking with the crewmen
from the ore freighters because
they got in trouble with the
first mate, and not talking with
yourself because you got in trouble
with the psychologist.</p>

<p>They took care of you in the
Education Service; they guarded
your diet and your virtue, your
body and your mind. Everything
but your happiness.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">There</span> was lots to do, of
course. You could prepare lessons
and read papers and cheap
novels in the miners' library, or
nail some more tin on your quarters
to keep out the wind and the
dust and the little animals. You
could go walking to the edge of
town and look at all the pretty
gray stones and the trees, like
squashed-down barrel cactus;
watch the larger sun sink behind
the horizon with its little companion
star circling around it,
diving out of sight to the right
and popping up again on the
left. And Saturday night&mdash;yippee!&mdash;three-year-old
movies in the
tin hangar. And, after five years,
they come and say, "Here's Miss
So-and-So, your relief, and here's
your five thousand credits and
wouldn't you like to sign up for
another term?"</p>

<p>Ha!</p>

<p>So they give you your ticket
back to Earth. You're on the
transport at last, and who can
blame you if you act just a little
crazy and eat like a pig and take
baths three times a day and lie
around your stateroom and just
dream about getting home and
waking up in your own room in
the morning and getting a good
cup of real coffee at the corner
fountain and kissing some handsome
young fellow on the library
steps when the Moon is full behind
the bell tower?</p>

<p>"And will the young fellow like
you?" she asked herself, knowing
the answer even as she asked the
question.</p>

<p>She whirled about in the middle
of the stateroom, her robe
swirling around her, and ended
with a deep curtsy to the full-length
mirror.</p>

<p>"Allow me to introduce myself,"
she murmured. "Lenore
Smithson, formerly of the Government
Education Service, just
back from business out on the
Rim. What? Why, of course you
may have this dance. Your name?
Mr. Fairheart! Of the billionaire
Fairhearts?" She waltzed with
herself a moment. Halting before
the mirror again, she surveyed
herself critically.</p>

<p>"Well," she said aloud, "the five
years didn't completely ruin you,
after all. Your nose still turns up
and your cheeks still dimple
when you smile. You have a nice
tan and your hair's grown long
again. Concentrated food hasn't
hurt your figure, either." She
turned this way and that before
the mirror to observe herself.</p>

<p>Then suddenly she gave a little
gasp of surprise and fright, for a
cascade of laughter had flooded
soundlessly inside her head.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">She</span> stood frozen before the
mirror while the laughter continued.
Then she slowly swung
around. It ceased abruptly. She
looked around the compartment,
staring accusingly at each article
of furniture in turn; then quickly
spun around to look behind her,
meeting her own startled gaze in
the mirror.</p>

<p>Opening the door slowly, she
ventured to thrust her head out
into the corridor. It was deserted,
the long rows of doors all closed
during the afternoon rest period.
As she stood there, a steward
came along the corridor with a
tray of glasses, nodded to her,
and passed on out of sight. She
turned back into the room and
stood there, leaning against the
door, listening.</p>

<p>Suddenly the laughter came
again, bursting out as though it
had been suppressed and could be
held back no longer. Clear, merry,
ringing and completely soundless,
it poured through her mind.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she cried aloud.
"What's happening?"</p>

<p>"My dear young lady," said a
man's voice within her head, "allow
me to introduce myself. My
name is Fairheart. Of the billionaire
Fairhearts. May I have the
next dance?"</p>

<p>"This is it," she thought. "Five
years on the rock pile would do
it to anyone. You've gone mad."</p>

<p>She laughed shakily. "I can't
dance with you if I can't see you."</p>

<p>"I really should explain," the
voice replied, "and apologize for
my silly joke. It was frightfully
rude to laugh at you, but when
I saw you waltzing and preening
yourself, I just couldn't help it.
I'm a telepath, you see, from
Dekker's star, out on the Rim."</p>

<p>That would explain, she
thought, his slightly stilted
phraseology; English was apparently
not his native tongue&mdash;or,
rather, his native thought.</p>

<p>"There was a mild mutation
among the settlers there, and the
third generation all have this
ability. I shouldn't use it, I know,
but I've been so lonely, confined
here to my room, that I cast
around to see if there were anyone
that I could talk to. Then I
came upon you considering your
own virtues, and you were so cute
and funny that I couldn't resist.
Then I laughed and you caught
me."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"I've</span> heard of telepaths," she
said doubtfully, "though I've
never heard of Dekker's star.
However, I don't think you have
any right to go thinking around
the ship spying on people."</p>

<p>"Sh!" whispered the silent
voice. "You needn't shout. I'll go
away if you wish and never spy
on you again, but don't tell Captain
Blake, or he'll have me sealed
in a lead-lined cell or something.
We're not supposed to
telepath around others, but I've
been sitting here with all sorts of
interesting thoughts just tickling
the edges of my mind for so long
that I had to go exploring."</p>

<p>"Why not go exploring on your
own two feet like anyone else?
Have you so much brains, your
head's too heavy to carry?"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately," the voice
mourned, "my trouble is in my
foot and not in my head. On the
second night out from Dekker's
star, I lost my footing on the
stairs from the dining hall and
plunged like a comet to the bottom.
I would probably have been
killed but for the person of a
stout steward who, at that moment,
started to ascend the stairs.
He took the full impact of my
descent on his chest and saved
my life, I'm sure. However, I still
received a broken ankle that has
given me so much pain that I
have been forced to remain in my
cabin.</p>

<p>"I have had no one to talk to
except the steward who brings me
my meals, and, as he is the one
whom I met on the stairs, he has
little to say. In the morning he
frowns at me, at noon he glowers,
and in the evening he remarks
hopefully, 'Foot still pretty bad?'
Thus, I'm starved for conversation."</p>

<div class="figr"><img src="images/001.png" width="366" height="500" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>Lenore smiled at this earnest
speech. "I might talk with you
for a minute or two, but you must
admit that you have one advantage
over me. You can see me,
or so you say, and know what I
look like, but I can't see you. It
isn't fair."</p>

<p>"I can show myself to you," he
said, "but you'll have to help me
by closing your eyes and concentrating
very hard."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">She</span> closed her eyes and waited
expectantly. There was a moment
of darkness; then there appeared
in the middle of the darkness
a point of light, a globe, a
giant balloon of color. Suddenly
she was looking into the corner
of a stateroom which appeared
to hang in space. In the center
of the area stood a handsome
young man in a startling black
and orange lounging robe, holding
on to the back of a chair.</p>

<p>She opened her eyes; for an
instant the vision of the young
telepath hung in the air over her
couch like a ghostly double exposure.
Then it faded and the
room was empty.</p>

<p>"That's a terrible effort," came
his thought, "particularly when
I have to balance on one foot at
the same time. Well, now are we
even?"</p>

<p>Abandoning her post by the
door, she moved to the couch and
sat down. "I'm really disappointed,"
she smiled. "I was sure you'd
have two heads. But I think you
do have nice eyes and a terrible
taste in bathrobes." She took a
cigarette from her case and lit
it carefully. Then she remembered
her manners and extended the
case to the empty air. "Won't you
have one?"</p>

<p>"I certainly would like to. I'm
all out of them until the steward
brings my dinner. But I'm afraid
I'll have to wait, unless you can
blow the smoke through the ventilators
to me, or unless ... you
bring me one?"</p>

<p>Lenore blushed and changed
the subject. "Tell me, what do
you do all day in your stateroom?
Do you read? Do you play the
flute? Do you telepath sweet
nothings across the light-years to
your girl friend on Dekker's
star?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid my telepathic powers
are a bit short-ranged to reach
Dekker's star," he replied. "Besides,
what girl would commune
with me through the depths of
space when some other young
man is calling her from the dancing
pavilion? And my musical
talents are limited. However, I
do read. I brought some books
connected with the research I intend
to do on Earth for my degree,
and I have spent many
happy hours poring over the
thrilling pages of <i>Extraterrestrial
Entomology</i> and <i>Galactic Arachnida</i>."</p>

<p>"I came better prepared than
you did," she said. "Perhaps I
could lend you some of my books.
I have novels, plays, poetry, and
one very interesting volume called
<i>Progressive Education under Rim
Star Conditions</i>. But," she lowered
her voice to a whisper, "I
must tell you a secret about that
last one."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I haven't even opened it."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">They</span> laughed together, her
merriment bubbling aloud in
her cabin, his echoing silently inside
her mind.</p>

<p>"I haven't time to read a
novel," his thought came, "and
drama always bored me, but I
must confess to a weakness for
poetry. I love to read it aloud,
to throw myself into a heroic
ballad and rush along, spouting
grand phrases as though
they were my own and feeling
for a moment as though I were
really striding the streets of ancient
Rome, pushing west on the
American frontier or venturing
out into space in the first wild,
reckless, heroic days of rocket
travel. But I soon founder. I get
swept away by the rhythm, lost
in the intricacies of cadence and
rhyme, and, when the pace slows
down, when the poem becomes
soft and delicate and the meaning
is hidden behind a foliage of little
gentle words, I lose myself
entirely."</p>

<p>She said softly, "Perhaps I
could help you interpret some
verses."</p>

<p>Then she waited, clasping her
hands to keep them from trembling
with the tiny thrill of excitement
she felt.</p>

<p>"That would be kind of you,"
he said after a pause. "You could
read, there, and I could listen,
here, and feel what you feel as
you read ... or, if you wished ..."
Another pause. "Would you
care to come down?"</p>

<p>She could not help smiling.
"You're too good a mind reader.
A girl can't have any secrets any
more."</p>

<p>"Now look here," he burst out.
"I wouldn't have said anything,
but I was so lonely and you're
the only friendly person I've come
in contact with and ..."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," she laughed.
"Of course I'll come down and
read to you. I'd love to. What's
your cabin number?"</p>

<p>"It hasn't got a number because&mdash;actually
I work on this
ship so I'm away from the passengers'
quarters. But I can direct
you easily. Just start down the
hall to your left and ..."</p>

<p>"My dear sir," she cried, "just
wait a minute! I can't come visiting
in my robe, you know; I'll
have to change. But while I dress,
you must take your spying little
thoughts away. If I detect you
peeking in here at the wrong moment,
I'll run straight to Captain
Blake and have him prepare his
special lead-lined cell for one unhappy
telepath. So you just run
along. When I'm ready, I'll call
you and you can lead me to your
lair."</p>

<p>He thought only the one word,
"Hurry," but in the silence after
he was gone she fancied she heard
her heart echoing him, loud in
the stillness.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">She</span> laughed gaily to herself.
"Now stop acting like a
schoolgirl before the Junior Prom.
You've got to get busy and wash
and dress and comb and brush."
And then to her reflection in the
mirror: "Aren't you a lucky girl?
You're still millions and billions
of miles from Earth and it's starting
already, and he's going to do
research there for some time, and
maybe at the university in your
home town if you tell him just
how nice it is, and he doesn't
know any other girls, you'd have
an inside track. Now you'd better
get going or you'll never be ready.</p>

<p>"For reading poetry, don't you
think this dress is just the thing,
this nice soft blue one that goes
so well with your tan and shows
your legs, which are really quite
pretty, you know.... And your
silver sandals and those silver
pins ... just a touch of perfume....
That's right; and now a little
lipstick. You do have a pretty
smile.... There, that's right. Now
stop admiring yourself and let's
go."</p>

<p>She moved to the bookshelf,
frowning now, considered, selected
and rejected. Finally she settled
on three slim books bound in
russet leather, in glossy plastic,
in faded cloth. She took a little
purse from the table, put the cigarette
case into it. Then, with a
laugh, she took one cigarette and
slipped it into a tiny pocket on
her skirt.</p>

<p>"I really meant to bring you
one," she whispered to the empty
air, "but wasn't I mean to tease?"</p>

<p>In the corridor, she walked
quickly past the rows of closed
doors to the tiny refreshment
stand at the foot of the dining
room stairs. The attendant rose
from his stool as she approached,
and came to the counter.</p>

<p>"I'd like two frosted starlights,
please," she said, "on a tray."</p>

<p>"Two," said the attendant, and
nothing more, but his eyebrow
climbed up his forehead, hung for
a second, then slowly drooped
back to normal, as if to say that
after all these years he no longer
puzzled about a lovely young girl
who came around in the middle
of a Wednesday rest period,
dressed like Saturday night and
smelling of perfume, ordering
two intoxicating drinks&mdash;when
she was obviously traveling alone.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Lenore</span> felt a thrill of secret
pleasure go through her, a
feeling of possessing a delicious
secret, a delightful sensation of
reckless gaiety, of life stirring
throughout the sleepy ship, of a
web of secrets and countersecrets
hidden from everyone but this
unconcerned observer.</p>

<p>She walked back down the corridor,
balancing the tray. When
a little splashed over the rim of
the tall glasses, she took a sip
from each, tasting the sweet, cold
liquid in her throat.</p>

<p>When she came to the head of
the stairs, she realized that she
did not even know her telepath's
name. Closing her eyes, she said
very slowly and distinctly inside
her head, "Mr. Fairheart?"</p>

<p>Instantly his thought was with
her, overpowering, as breathless
as an embrace. "Where are you?"</p>

<p>"At the head of the central
stairs."</p>

<p>"Down you go."</p>

<p>She went down the stairs,
through more corridors, down
more stairs, while he guided her
steps. Once she paused to sip
again at each glass when the
liquid splashed as she was going
down. The ice tickled her nose
and made her sneeze.</p>

<p>"You live a long way down,"
she said.</p>

<p>"I've got to be near my
charges," he answered. "I told
you I work on the ship; I'm a
zoologist classifying any of the
new specimens of extraterrestrial
life they're always picking up.
And I always get stuck with the
worst quarters on the ship. Why,
I can't even call all my suite my
own. The whole front room is
filled with some sort of ship's
gear that my steward stumbles
over every meal time."</p>

<p>She went on and on, down and
down. "How many flights?" she
wondered. "Two or twelve or
twenty?" Now, why couldn't she
remember? Only four little sips
and her mind felt so cloudy.
Down another corridor, and what
was that funny smell? These passages
were poorly ventilated in
the lower levels; probably that
was what made her feel so dizzy.</p>

<p>"Only one more flight," he
whispered. "Only one more."</p>

<p>Down and along and then the
door. She paused, conscious of
rising excitement, conscious of her
beating heart.</p>

<p>Dimly she noticed the sign on
the door. "You&mdash;you mean whatever
it is you're taking care of is
in there with you?"</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened," his persuasive
thought came. "It can't
hurt you. It's locked in a cage."</p>

<p>Then she slid the bolt and
turned the handle. Her head hurt
for an instant; and she was inside,
a blue and silver shadow in
the dim anteroom, with the tray
in her hand and the books under
her arm and her pulse hammering.</p>

<p>She looked around the dim
anteroom, at the spidery tangle
of orange and black ropes against
the left-hand wall; then at the
doorway in the right-hand wall
with the warm light streaming
through. He was standing in the
second room, one hand on the
chair for support, the other extended
toward her. For the first
time he spoke aloud.</p>

<p>"Hello, butterfly," he said.</p>

<p>"Hello," she said. She smiled
and walked forward into the light.
She reached out for his hand.</p>

<p>Then she stopped short, her
hand pressed against an impenetrable
wall.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">She</span> could see him standing
there, smiling, reaching for
her hand, but there was an invisible
barrier between them. Then,
slowly, his room began to fade,
the light dimmed, his figure grew
watery, transparent, vanished.
She was standing, staring at the
riveted steel bulkhead of a compartment
which was lit only by
the dim light filtering through the
thick glass over the transom.</p>

<p>She stood there frozen, and the
ice in the glasses tinkled nervously.
Then the tray slipped from
her fingers and clattered to the
floor. Icy liquid splashed the silver
sandals. In the silent gloom
she stood immobile, her eyes wide
in her white face, her fist pressed
to her mouth, stifling a scream.</p>

<p>Something touched her gently
at head and wrist and ankle&mdash;all
over her body. The web clung,
delicate as lace, strong as steel.</p>

<p>Even if she had been able to
move, she could not have broken
free as the thing against the wall
began to clamber down the
strands on eight furred legs.</p>

<p>"Hello, butterfly," he said
again.</p>
